                        <div class="answer">
                            <p class="fw-semibold text-start">EyeCanDo is an innovative eye gaze-based application designed specifically for ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) patients to facilitate communication. It leverages advanced eye-tracking technology to allow users to interact with their devices using only their eyes. This technology enables patients, who may have lost the ability to speak or move, to communicate their needs, interact with smart home devices, and access various forms of digital communication such as texting and emailing. By restoring some degree of independence, EyeCanDo significantly improves the quality of life for ALS patients and their caregivers.</p>

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>EyeCanDo employs cutting-edge filtering and calibration techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of its eye gaze tracking. The app uses a weighted average filter to smooth out gaze data and an outlier correction filter to handle sudden eye movements or 'saccades.' These methods reduce noise and ensure that the eye gaze cursor remains stable and precise, even during rapid eye movements. This superior tracking capability makes EyeCanDo a highly effective tool for communication and control, outperforming many existing solutions.</p>
