                        <p class="fw-semibold">EyeCanDo is an eye gaze-based app running on the iOS/iPadOS platform. For a better experience, while using our service, you need to allow our app to access your camera for eye tracking on your device, otherwise only touch-based control is enabled. During use of the app, the app may collect some data for eye tracking such as the positions of your eye gazes and the movements of your face. The front facing camera is used for eye gaze estimation and the eye gaze will be used to support gaze based operations we provide. When you exit our app, all data regarding eye gaze and facial information will be discarded automatically. We do not collect any personally identifiable information. Eye gaze data is never stored remotely and neither is it shared with any third parties. You are not required to create an account or register to use the app, and we do not collect information about who has downloaded or used the app. We let people use our service ad-free.</p>

                            <h4 class="question">TrueDepth API</h4>
                            <p>We use TrueDepth API technologies to estimate a user's face and eye gaze, which is used for gaze based target selection and text input. Users can control the service by moving eye gazes or using facial expressions. Trajectories of eye gaze are also used for smoothing the gaze and optimizing target selection and text input for improved efficiency. No information collected by TrueDepth API, including user’s eye gaze data and facial expression data, will leave the user’s device. The data will be removed from the device once the app is closed.</p>
